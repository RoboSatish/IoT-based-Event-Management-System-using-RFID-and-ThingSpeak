# IoT-based-Event-Management-System-using-RFID-and-ThingSpeak

RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification, itâ€™s a very simple and inexpensive piece of technology that can be used to make applications such as RFID Based Door Lock, RFID based Attendance System. If you search online for RFID Based Projects, you will find many projects that are associated with security and tagging which might make this interesting module appear boring. To change the trend, we thought of building an RFID Based IoT Enabled Event Management System that not only monitors the entry log but with the help of IoT technology but can also send the Log and Entry data directly to a dedicated server that can handle all the authentication, authorization, and management making the whole process seamless.
